program dir should contain:

lib -
	all the libraries one collects over time and places everywhere....

licenses -
	all a company's licenses including the basics that should ship with this.

just possibly....
	add a folder for custom functions that improve upon any built-ins, like:
		--printerr
		--opteval
		--trap
		...etc	

	
contain settings or defaults when wanted...
	? this is a difficult choice...
